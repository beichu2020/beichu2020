# 1 算法
## 1 [IMU_Attitude_Estimator](https://github.com/beichu2020/IMU_Attitude_Estimator)

This project is aimed at estimating the attitude of Attitude Heading and Reference System(AHRS). And the project contains three popular attitude estimator algorithms.
- Mahony's algorithm
- Extend Kalman Filter(EKF)
- Error State Kalman Filter(ESKF)

## 2 [经典卡尔曼算法对比](https://github.com/beichu2020/3_state_filter)

来自大师 priseborough，包括EKF,GSF_EKF,IMMEKF,PF,UKF滤波融合算法实现，非常适合入门学习分析。

## 1 [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
从草图生成高清的细节图像，非常Nice.
Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model. Thanks to a generous compute donation from Stability AI and support from LAION, we were able to train a Latent Diffusion Model on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B database. Similar to Google's Imagen, this model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM. See this section below and the model card.

This repository is a collection of studies, art styles, prompts and other useful tools you can use throughout your exploration of the latent space.
As Stable Diffusion is still in beta and subject to lots of changes, the Records will often change to reflect new information.

Watching a vibrant Seattle sunset the other day, my imagination started running. The otherworldly hue of the sky evoked something from science fiction. The hazy orange-purple was mesmerizing.
